# Quantitative-Management-Modeling

A variety of optimization and heuristic modeling techniques are explored. Decision-making environments, model selection, and interpretation are emphasized. 
Various linear and nonlinear mathematical programming techniques are the primary topic but are supplemented with other optimization and heuristic techniques.

Here, I have implemented the below techniques to solve various industrial problems to gain Profit or minimum loss for Production Line.
- Linear Programming
- Simplex, Duality Theory and Sensitivity Analysis
- Transportation and Assignment Problem
- Integer Programming
- DEA and Goal Programming
